# Words of Advice

---
class: center,middle

## "Difficult"
## "High Workload"

(but also "fun", "learned a lot")

---
class: center,middle

## Expected workload
## 10 hours/week


But your mileage may vary

---
class: center,middle

## Learning in NUS SoC is different from your experience

---
class: center,middle

### Less rote learning
### More open-ended problems
### A lot more self-learning

---
class: center,middle,wide

### Cannot "study" programming / problem solving

### Need to actually _do it_

---
class: middle

### _Don't_: Stop at understanding the notes

### _Do_: "play" with it, ask "what if..", "why..", "why not..", etc

---
class: center,middle

### _Don't:_ do it alone

### _Do:_ Discuss with classmates and teaching team

---
class: center,middle

### _Don't:_ Optimize for CAP and grades

### _Do:_ Optimize for skills, knowledge, and experience

---
class: center,middle

### _Don't:_ Do enough to get things done

### _Do:_ Invest time to master the tools

(e.g., `bash`, `vim`, `git`, etc)

---
class: center,middle,wide

### _Don't:_ focus on meeting assignment deadline

### _Do:_ think long term (your career)

---
class: middle

- No matter how well you have done to get here
- No matter what you know about programming

### This is a fresh start

# Lecture 1

### 9 August 2021

Admin Matters<br>
Unit 1: **What is a Program?**<br>
Unit 2: **Computational Problems and Algorithms**<br>

---
class: middle,center

## What is a program?
---
class: middle,center

### A sequence of step-by-step instructions given to computers to process data in order to perform a certain task.
---
class: middle,center

### How CPU Executes a Program

.fit[![simplified](figures/simplified-cpu-mem-dark.png)]

.tiny[(A highly simplfied view)]

---
## Machine Code

- Instructions that can be interpreted by a CPU

- Different CPU architecture may use different instruction sets

`1001010001011110100010101010101000101`

---
## Assembly Language

- Use mnemonic to represent the instructions such as `incr`, `decr`, `store`, etc. in a more human-readable way.

- Still difficult to write: operation that is conceptually simple still requires multiple instructions to be issued.

---
## Higher-Level Language

- Allow programmers to express an operation closer to their intention

- E.g., $x = x + y$ if $y < 0$


---
## Higher-Level Languages

- FORTRAN (first popular programming language from 1950s)

- C (1972, still influential today)

- Many many others

---
## Compilation

A compiler _compiles_ a program written in high-level language to machine code.

## What is a computational problem?

---
class: middle

### Computational problems are

- problems that can be solved _step-by-step_ by a computer

- have _well-defined_ inputs, outputs, and constraints

### How to Solve It?

- Scan the integers one-by-one

- Keep track of the "max so far"

- When we are done scanning, the "max so far" will be the answer.

---
class: middle

### Problem Formulation

- Input: $L$ = $\langle l\_0,...,l\_{k-1\} \rangle$

- Output: $m$

- Constraint $m \in L$ and $m \ge l_i$ for all $i$.

---
class: middle

### Scan One-By-One

- $l_i$ : The number being scanned

- $i = 0, 1, \ldots k-1$

---
class: middle

### "Maximum So Far"

- $m$ : max so far

- $m = l_0$ initially

---
class: middle

### Keeping track 

- Compare $m$ with $l\_i$

- if $m < l\_i$, then update $m$ with the value of $l\_i$.

---
class: middle

### Done scanning?

- When we have scanned $l\_{k-1}$

---
class: middle

### The steps to solve a computational problem form the _algorithm_

---
class: middle

## Flowchart

$k$ | $i$ | $l\_i$ | $m$

    |     |        |

    |     |        |  
    |     |        |    
]

---
### Variables

- $i$, $m$, $k$ are _variables_
- They have corresponding location in the memory and hold a _value_
- You can _read_ a value from a variable
- You can _write_ a value to a variable

---
### Assignment

- We can assign the value of a variable to a constant (e.g., set $i$ to 1)
- or to the value of another variable (e.g., set $m$ to $l_i$).

---
### Comparison

- We can compare the values of two variables
- E.g., $i$ equals $k$?  $l\_i > m$? 

---
### Arithmetic Operations

- We can perform arithmetic operations 
- E.g., we set $i$ to $i + 1$

---
class: middle

### Does this algorithm always correctly find the maximum value? 

.fit[![flowchart](figures/max-flowchart-dark/max-flowchart-dark.001.png)]

---
class: middle

### Correctness 

- If an algorithm produces the correct output for one instance of input, it is not necessary correct

- To be correct, it has to produce the correct output _for all possible_ inputs!

---
class: middle

### How to check for correctness?

- Carefully choose a set of test cases to try
- Argue formally about the properties of the algorithms
---
class: middle

  - Due Wednesday 2359
  - You have unlimited attempts
- Problem Set 1.1 to 1.3 
  - Not graded.  To be discussed Week 3.
