Learning Outcomes After this unit, students should: have an idea of what is a program and how a program is executed by a computer understand the basic terminologies: machine code, assembly language, and higher-level programming languages What is a (computer) program? Despite all the wonderful and amazing things that computers can do, computers are not very smart. In fact, they are pretty dumb. Computers can only follow the instructions given by a human. A computer program is a sequence of step-by-step instructions given to computers to manipulate data in order to perform a certain task. Programming is the art and science of writing a computer program, and that is what you will learn to do in CS1010. How computer executes a program In order to learn how to write a program, it is important to have an overview of how a computer executes a program. You will learn in details how this is done in CS2100/CS2106 or EE2024/CG2271, but for CS1010, we will take a very simplistic and high-level view of this process. The two important components of a computer we will discuss for CS1010 is the CPU, or central processing unit and the memory, which is a generalized term for where we store the data to be processed or manipulated by the CPU, as well as the instructions to do so. A memory location is addressable using a memory address . The instructions to the CPU comes in the form of machine code , a sequence of bits (1s and 0s) that is interpreted and then followed by the CPU to do certain things. These machine code could instruct the CPU, for instance, to compare if a particular number at a certain memory location is more than 0, to add one number to another, or to execute another instruction at another memory location. The data stored in the memory is also stored as a sequence of 1s and 0s. From Machine Code to High-level Programming Language While it is possible for us, human, to write machine code directly, few actually do since it is challenging to do so. Different CPUs understand different sets of machine code; it is tedious to figure out where each piece of data is located in the memory (this location is actually determined by the operating system). The resulting code, even when it is correct and easy to read and understand by the machine, are often hard to decipher for a human. Simple operations such as comparing two numbers to see which one is bigger might require several instructions to perform. To get around the readability problem, programmers can code in assembly language -- a human-readable form of machine code, where each instruction, instead of represented by 0s and 1s, is represented by a mnemonic (such as decr , incr , store , add , etc.) Writing assembly code does not address the issues of machine-dependent code and the tediousness of programming. Early programmers (in the fifties) understood this and designed high-level programming languages , where programmers can describe the operations that they wish to do in a language closer to their intention that is machine independent. A program written in one of these programming languages is then compiled into machine code for a specific CPU for execution using a compiler. The first commercially available language is FORTRAN from IBM in the 1950s. Among many early programming languages, C (birth year 1972) is the only one that is still popular and widely used today, For many reasons , C is the language of choice for CS1010. The Goals of CS1010 This brings us to the goals of CS1010. First, you will learn the most important syntax element of the C programming language. Second, you will learn how a C program behaves, in relation to how a program is executed and how data are stored and manipulated in memory. Third, you will learn the various tools and techniques that will help you produce good and correct C programs.

Computational Problems So, what is computational problem solving? Let's start with the question, what is a computational problem ? A computational problem is a problem that can be solved step-by-step with a computer. These problems usually have a well-defined input, constraints, and conditions that the output must satisfied. Here are some types of computational problems: A decision problem is one where the answer is yes or no. For instance, \"given a number \\(n\\) , is \\(n\\) even?\" is a decision problem. Some decision problems take more steps to solve than others. For instance, \"given a number \\(n\\) , is \\(n\\) prime?\" takes more steps than just checking the parity of a number. A search problem is one where the solution consists of one or more values that satisfies a given condition. For instance, we may want to compute a path from one geographical location to another on a map. A counting problem is one where the answer is the number of solutions to a search problem. An optimization problem is one where the solution is the \"best\" possible solution, where the \"best\" can be defined in a different way. For instance, we may want to compute the fastest route from one location to another. Questions such as \"what is the meaning of life?\" \"do I look good in this outfit?\" 1 are not computational problems, because they do not have well-defined input, constraints, and conditions that the output must satisfy. In CS1010 (followed by CS2040C and CS3230), you will learn how to solve computational problems computationally -- this means that you learn to come up with step-by-step instructions meant for computers that you can translate into computer programs, to solve a given problem. Example: Finding the maximum Let's start with a simple problem. Given a finite list \\(L\\) of \\(k\\) integers ( \\(k\\) > 0), find the maximum integer from the list. First, let's consider if this is a computational problem. The input is very well defined. We know what an integer is. We are told we have at least one, and we have a finite number of them 2 . Second, let's consider the output. What conditions must the output satisfy? First, it has to be equal or larger than every other integer on the list. Second, it must be an integer in the list. This is well defined by the problem statement, so we can say that it is a computational problem. Here is an example. Suppose the input consists of: 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 The output should be 9 . Now, you should pause reading and think about how you would solve this step-by-step. Algorithm One way to solve this problem is to check through the integers in the list, one-by-one, and keep track of the maximum value so far. When you reach the end of the list, your \"maximum value so far\" will also be the maximum for the whole list. Let's look at an example: Integers Scanned Maximum So Far 4 4 4 1 4 4 1 -4 4 4 1 -4 0 4 4 1 -4 0 9 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 9 The English description above, however, is not detailed enough for computers to understand. What is the meaning of \"check one-by-one\"? \"keep track of maximum so far\"? how to tell if we have reached \"the end of the list\"? Let's work out all the details. First, we need a concise way of representing the integers in the list. Borrowing from mathematical notation, let's say that the list \\(L\\) contains the integers \\(l_0, l_1, ..., l_{k-1}\\) . To \"check one-by-one,\" we introduce another notation \\(l_i\\) , which is the integer currently being \"checked\". We begin with \\(i = 0\\) , then \\(i = 1\\) , then \\(i = 2\\) , etc, until \\(i = k-1\\) . At every step, we increase \\(i\\) by 1. Second, we need a concise way of keeping track of the maximum so far. We introduce another notation, \\(m\\) , to represent the maximum value so far. When \\(i = 0\\) , \\(m = l_0\\) . Since we only scan a single integer, it has to be the maximum. When we check another integer \\(l_i (i > 0)\\) , only two things can happen: if this \\(l_i\\) is larger than \\(m\\) , then \\(l_i\\) has to be the maximum so far, so we update \\(m\\) to be \\(l_i\\) . if \\(l_i\\) is equal to or smaller than \\(m\\) , then \\(m\\) is still the maximum value so far. We keep doing the above and increase \\(i\\) , until we reach the end of the list when (after increasing \\(i\\) ) we find that \\(i\\) is \\(k\\) . Now, we have enough details to describe step-by-step, how to find the maximum value from a list of integers. Such steps, which the computer can take to solve a problem, is called an algorithm . Flowchart There are different ways one can describe an algorithm. The easiest way I find is to use a diagram called a flowchart . The flowchart for the algorithm above looks like this. There are several components to a flowchart. We will use the following convention in CS1010: An arrow indicates the direction of the flow, i.e., what is the next step of the algorithm. A rounded rectangle denotes either the starting (inputs) or ending point (output) of the algorithm. A diamond box represents a \"question\" that can be true or false (yes or no). It indicates a \"branch\" in the flow. Which branch we follow is deteremined the answer to the question in the box. A rectangle represents one or more \"operations\" (such as initialization or manipulation of data) To understand the flowchart above, let's trace through it with the sample input. We will maintain the following table as we trace through the flowchart. At the beginning, just before entering \" \\(i\\) equals \\(k\\) ?\", we have the following: Integers Scanned \\(i\\) \\(l_i\\) \\(k\\) Maximum So Far ( \\(m\\) ) 4 1 1 9 4 Subsequently, we enter a \"loop\", and the values assigned to the symbols at the point after \" \\(i\\) equals \\(k\\) ?\" can be traced as follows: Integers Scanned \\(i\\) \\(l_i\\) \\(k\\) Maximum So Far ( \\(m\\) ) 4 1 1 1 9 4 4 1 -4 2 -4 9 4 4 1 -4 0 3 0 9 4 4 1 -4 0 9 4 9 9 4 4 1 -4 0 9 9 5 9 9 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 6 3 9 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 7 5 9 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 8 8 9 9 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 9 `` 9 9 Please spend some time to trace through the flowchart above. Variables There are a few important things to take note here. \\(m\\) , \\(i\\) , \\(k\\) , and the list \\(L\\) are what we called states or variables . While in the above, we can think of them as mathematical variables which we can assign values to, in a computer program, a variable is a location in the memory which holds a value. We can perform two very basic operations on the variables: reading and writing. In other words, we can set their values and we can retrieve their values. We can assign the value of one variable to a constant (e.g., set \\(i\\) to 1) or to the value of another variable (e.g., set \\(m\\) to \\(l_i\\) ). In the latter example, we first read the value of \\(l_i\\) , from \\(l_i\\) 's memory location and then we write that value to the memory location of \\(m\\) . Once written, the value of \\(m\\) will not change until the next time we update the value of \\(m\\) . It is important to note that, when \\(i\\) changes, \\(m\\) does not change automatically to the new \\(l_i\\) This behavior is different from that which you may be familiar with in spreadsheet software -- if you set the value of a cell, say A1 to be =B1 , when the value in cell B1 changes, the value A1 also changes automatically. We can also compare the values of two variables. We see two examples above: \" \\(i\\) equals \\(k\\) ?\" \" \\(l_i > m\\) ?\" When we compare, we read the values of the variables from their memory location and checks their relations. We can perform arithmetic operations on the variables: addition, subtraction, etc. We see one example above: \"increment \\(i\\) \". This operation is actually an assignment operation in disguise. We can write it as \"set \\(i\\) to \\(i\\) + 1\". Here, you see that \\(i\\) is referred to twice. This operation reads the value from the memory location of \\(i\\) , adds 1 to it, and then writes the resulting value back to the location of \\(i\\) . Bugs If you follow the execution of the algorithm above, step-by-step, using the example input 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 above, you will obtain the correct maximum value \\(m\\) of 9 . But does that mean that the algorithm is correct? The answer is NO. For an algorithm to correctly solve the given problem, it has to produce the correct result for all valid inputs to the problem. If we can find one counterexample, one input where the algorithm does not produce the correct output, then the algorithm is incorrect. Note that I say does not produce the correct output , which means that either the algorithm produces the wrong output or does not produce any output at all . In this case, we say that the algorithm or the program has a bug . A bug is a defect that causes the algorithm to behave incorrectly. As a software developer, you will spend some time finding bugs in your code, a process known as debugging . A debugger is a tool that helps programmers find bugs in their code. Before we even start the process of debugging, we first have to know if our algorithm is correct. Remember that an algorithm is correct only if it produces the correct output only all possible valid inputs. So, one way to check if an algorithm is correct is to try it with all possible valid inputs. For the problem we are solving above, however, even though the list is finite, there are infinitely many possible inputs, and so, it is impossible to try all possible valid inputs. In practice, we craft a smaller set of test inputs to check if the algorithm behaves correctly for these test inputs, and hope that it is correct for all possible inputs. With experience, you will choose the right set of test inputs to maximize that chances that you will find a bug in your code. There are also systematic ways of deriving test cases so that the test cases cover different paths of execution of the algorithm, but we won't be covering it in CS1010 3 . Another way of checking if an algorithm is correct, is to reason about the behavior of the algorithm. We will do this rather informally in CS1010, starting in 1-2 lectures from now. You get to rigorously prove that an algorithm is correct in a higher level module (CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms). Finally, even if an algorithm is correct, the corresponding program might not be. Recall that an algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve a problem. It is what you want your program to do. You still have to write a program (in C, or other languages) to actually have the computer do what you want it to do (in other words, to implement the algorithm ). This process of translating the algorithm to a computer program, called coding may introduce bugs as well. But we will worry about this later when we learn to program. In the problem set at the end of this lecture, you will see slight variations of the algorithm above. You should check through them to see whether they are correct or not. Problem Set Problem 1.1 The following algorithms are slight variations of the one in the notes above. The differences are highlighted in red. Do they correctly find the maximum integer from a finite list of \\(k\\) integers ( \\(k > 0\\) )? If an algorithm is buggy, give a counter-example where the output is incorrect. In addition, give an example input where the algorithm still produces the correct output, where possible. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Problem 1.2 Change the algorithm above to find the minimum value instead of the maximum value from the given list \\(L = \\langle l_0, ..., l_{k-1}\\rangle\\) . You can also assume that the list \\(L\\) is finite and \\(k > 0\\) for this question. Problem 1.3 Draw the flowchart for an algorithm, that takes in a list of integers \\(L = \\langle l_0, ..., l_{k-1}\\rangle, k > 0\\) , and compute the sum of all the integers. Think about what variable(s) do you need. The answer is, by the way, always \"Yes.\" \u21a9 Think about why it is important to have a finite number of integers in the input. \u21a9 Software testing is a body of knowledge worthy of an advanced module by itself -- we offer one in CS4218. \u21a9","title":"2.

Since we only scan a single integer, it has to be the maximum. When we check another integer \\(l_i (i > 0)\\) , only two things can happen: if this \\(l_i\\) is larger than \\(m\\) , then \\(l_i\\) has to be the maximum so far, so we update \\(m\\) to be \\(l_i\\) . if \\(l_i\\) is equal to or smaller than \\(m\\) , then \\(m\\) is still the maximum value so far. We keep doing the above and increase \\(i\\) , until we reach the end of the list when (after increasing \\(i\\) ) we find that \\(i\\) is \\(k\\) . Now, we have enough details to describe step-by-step, how to find the maximum value from a list of integers. Such steps, which the computer can take to solve a problem, is called an algorithm .","title":"Algorithm"},{"location":"02-algo.html#flowchart","text":"There are different ways one can describe an algorithm. The easiest way I find is to use a diagram called a flowchart . The flowchart for the algorithm above looks like this. There are several components to a flowchart.

While in the above, we can think of them as mathematical variables which we can assign values to, in a computer program, a variable is a location in the memory which holds a value. We can perform two very basic operations on the variables: reading and writing. In other words, we can set their values and we can retrieve their values. We can assign the value of one variable to a constant (e.g., set \\(i\\) to 1) or to the value of another variable (e.g., set \\(m\\) to \\(l_i\\) ). In the latter example, we first read the value of \\(l_i\\) , from \\(l_i\\) 's memory location and then we write that value to the memory location of \\(m\\) . Once written, the value of \\(m\\) will not change until the next time we update the value of \\(m\\) . It is important to note that, when \\(i\\) changes, \\(m\\) does not change automatically to the new \\(l_i\\) This behavior is different from that which you may be familiar with in spreadsheet software -- if you set the value of a cell, say A1 to be =B1 , when the value in cell B1 changes, the value A1 also changes automatically. We can also compare the values of two variables. We see two examples above: \" \\(i\\) equals \\(k\\) ?\" \" \\(l_i > m\\) ?\" When we compare, we read the values of the variables from their memory location and checks their relations. We can perform arithmetic operations on the variables: addition, subtraction, etc. We see one example above: \"increment \\(i\\) \". This operation is actually an assignment operation in disguise. We can write it as \"set \\(i\\) to \\(i\\) + 1\". Here, you see that \\(i\\) is referred to twice. This operation reads the value from the memory location of \\(i\\) , adds 1 to it, and then writes the resulting value back to the location of \\(i\\) .","title":"Variables"},{"location":"02-algo.html#bugs","text":"If you follow the execution of the algorithm above, step-by-step, using the example input 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 above, you will obtain the correct maximum value \\(m\\) of 9 . But does that mean that the algorithm is correct? The answer is NO. For an algorithm to correctly solve the given problem, it has to produce the correct result for all valid inputs to the problem. If we can find one counterexample, one input where the algorithm does not produce the correct output, then the algorithm is incorrect. Note that I say does not produce the correct output , which means that either the algorithm produces the wrong output or does not produce any output at all . In this case, we say that the algorithm or the program has a bug . A bug is a defect that causes the algorithm to behave incorrectly. As a software developer, you will spend some time finding bugs in your code, a process known as debugging . A debugger is a tool that helps programmers find bugs in their code. Before we even start the process of debugging, we first have to know if our algorithm is correct. Remember that an algorithm is correct only if it produces the correct output only all possible valid inputs. So, one way to check if an algorithm is correct is to try it with all possible valid inputs. For the problem we are solving above, however, even though the list is finite, there are infinitely many possible inputs, and so, it is impossible to try all possible valid inputs. In practice, we craft a smaller set of test inputs to check if the algorithm behaves correctly for these test inputs, and hope that it is correct for all possible inputs. With experience, you will choose the right set of test inputs to maximize that chances that you will find a bug in your code. There are also systematic ways of deriving test cases so that the test cases cover different paths of execution of the algorithm, but we won't be covering it in CS1010 3 . Another way of checking if an algorithm is correct, is to reason about the behavior of the algorithm. We will do this rather informally in CS1010, starting in 1-2 lectures from now. You get to rigorously prove that an algorithm is correct in a higher level module (CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms). Finally, even if an algorithm is correct, the corresponding program might not be. Recall that an algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve a problem. It is what you want your program to do. You still have to write a program (in C, or other languages) to actually have the computer do what you want it to do (in other words, to implement the algorithm ). This process of translating the algorithm to a computer program, called coding may introduce bugs as well. But we will worry about this later when we learn to program.

Problem: Finding the Range Let's start with another problem. The range of a finite list of at least one integers \\(L\\) is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum integers in \\(L\\) . For example, the range for 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 is 13 . How do we find the range of a given list? To find the range of a list, we can break the solution down into three subtasks: first, find the maximum, then, find the minimum, and finally, find the difference between the two. From the previous lecture, you already know how to find the maximum and the minimum (from Problem 1.2)! So, in expressing the algorithm to find the range, we can refer to a previous solution to a sub-problem, which we assume we already know how to solve . Let's call our solution to find the maximum value from a given list \\(L\\) as \\(max\\) . \\(max\\) takes as input (i) a list \\(L\\) and (ii) \\(k\\) , the number of integers in \\(L\\) . It produces, or returns , the maximum value among the integers in \\(L\\) . Borrowing from mathematical notation, we use the notation \\(max(L, k)\\) to represent the maximum value of \\(L\\) . Note that, now, we no longer worry about \\(i\\) and \\(m\\) -- these two variables are now internal, or local , to \\(max(L,k)\\) . Suppose that \\(min(L,k)\\) returns the minimum value among the integers in \\(L\\) , then, the algorithm to find the range of \\(L\\) can be written in a single line: \\[max(L, k) - min(L, k)\\] Functions \\(max\\) and \\(min\\) are examples of a powerful and important concept with many names: function , procedure , subroutine , method , subprogram 1 . In the context of CS1010, we will use the term function . Functions allow us to solve a problem by thinking about the solution at a higher level. We no longer concern with the implementation details. For instance, in the example above, we no longer have to think about checking through the items in the list one-by-one and maintaining the maximum so far, or the minimum so far. We just have to think about how to compute the range, assuming that we already know how to compute the maximum and the minimum value. Such an assumption, that we already know how to solve a subproblem, is known as wishful thinking . Sometimes, it is useful to solve a problem assuming that you know how to solve the subproblem first, then worry about solving the subproblem later. For instance, consider the following problem: Given a finite list of \\(k\\) integers ( \\(k > 0\\) ), find the mean. The algorithm again can be written in one line: \\[sum(L, k) / k\\] if we assume that we have a function \\(sum\\) that can help us find the total of all \\(k\\) integers. It turns out, in this case, that you should also know how to solve the subproblem \\(sum\\) since it is Problem 1.3 from last week. We can then make this into a function itself, \\(mean(L, k)\\) , which we can now use to solve other more complex problems. Thinking in terms of functions also has another advantage: given a function, we only need to worry about what it does, but not how it is done. In the \\(max(L,k)\\) example above, we do not care if it scans the list \\(L\\) from \\(l_0\\) to \\(l_{k-1}\\) , or from \\(l_{k-1}\\) to \\(l_0\\) . We can treat a function as a black box with well-defined behavior -- given one or more inputs, it will produce a value satisfying certain conditions, i.e., it solves a computational problem. Many programming languages, including C which we will be using in CS1010, come with a rich set of predefined functions that we can use to help us solve computational problems. In CS1010, we will also provide you with some functions to help you with your lab assignments. You will also define your own functions when solving problems with C. In fact, a C program is just a collection of functions calling each other. Note, however, that in C, a function is more general than the description above: a C function may not take in any input, and it may not return any value. Problem: Finding Standard Deviation Let's look at another problem: Given \\(L\\) , a finite list of at least one integers, find the standard deviation of the integers in \\(L\\) . First, recall that the (population) standard deviation is given by \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (l_i - \\mu)^2}{k}}\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the integers in \\(L\\) . To compute the standard deviation, we first need to compute \\(\\mu\\) , the mean. We already know how to do that: \\(mean(L, k)\\) . Then, we need to compute \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (l_i - \\mu)^2\\) . We can break it down into two subproblems: Given a list \\(L\\) and a constant value \\(x\\) , subtract \\(x\\) from every number in \\(L\\) , giving us a new list. Given a list, square every number in the list, giving us a new list. For now, let's apply wishful thinking and assume that we know how to compute the above two steps with functions \\(subtract(L, k, x)\\) and \\(square(L, k)\\) , then, the formula \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (l_i - \\mu)^2\\) can be computed by the following steps: set \\(\\mu\\) to \\(mean(L, k)\\) set \\(L'\\) to \\(subtract(L, k, \\mu)\\) set \\(L''\\) to \\(square(L', k)\\) set \\(total\\) to \\(sum(L'', k)\\) . We can also write it in one line: set \\(total\\) to \\(sum(square(subtract(L, k, mean(L, k)), k), k)\\) Now, to compute the standard deviation, we need to divide \\(total\\) by \\(k\\) and find the square root. But, finding \\(total\\) and dividing the result by \\(k\\) is just \\(mean\\) . To compute square root, we again apply wishful thinking and assume that there is a function \\(sqrt\\) to do so. We can now compute the standard deviation with one line: \\[sqrt(mean(square(subtract(L, k, mean(L, k)), k), k))\\] Using functions, we can easily pass the output from one function as input to another, essentially chain the functions together, like Lego blocks, to solve problems. We also see an example of reuse here -- \\(mean\\) is used twice with different inputs. Returning a list While the above one-liner is an elegant solution, when we actually implement this in C later, it will not so simple and elegant. Let's worry about that later. Now that we have seen how to compute standard deviation by breaking it down the four subproblems, \\(sqrt\\) , \\(mean\\) , \\(square\\) , and \\(subtract\\) , we have to make sure that things we wish can be done can actually be done. The C library, and many programming languages, provide a pre-defined method to compute \\(sqrt\\) . We already know how to compute \\(mean\\) . Computing \\(square\\) can be done as follows: The implementation of \\(subtract\\) is similar. Another Solution for Finding Maximum In the previous lecture, you have seen an algorithm to find the maximum value from a list of integers, which involves checking the elements one-by-one and keeping track of the maximum value so far. Now that we have seen what a function is, we can use the concept of wishful thinking to help us solve this problem in a different way and more elegant way. Let's suppose that we have a function \\(max'(L, i, j)\\) , that finds the maximum integer among the elements \\(l_i, l_{i+1}, ... l_j\\) . The function \\(max(L, k)\\) , which finds the maximum among all elements of \\(L\\) , is therefore the same as \\(max'(L, 0, k-1)\\) . Do we know how to solve \\(max'(L, i, j)\\) without checking the integers in \\(L\\) one-by-one? Well, if \\(i\\) equals to \\(j\\) , i.e., there is only one element in the range of \\(l_i, ..., l_j\\) , then yes, the function should return the value of \\(l_i\\) . But, what if there are multiple elements in the range? (i.e., \\(i < j\\) )? By wishful thinking, we assume that we already know how to solve smaller (as in a shorter list) problem -- \\(max'(L, i+1, j)\\) , so the maximum value for the range of \\(l_i, ..., l_j\\) is the larger of the two: either \\(l_i\\) or \\(max'(L, i+1, j)\\) . We can express this algorithm as follows: Let's trace through the algorithm above, using our previous example: 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 . Given this list, we compare the first element, 4 , with the maximum of the rest of the list 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 . Since with wishful thinking, we know how to solve this already, we get 9 as the maximum value of 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 . Comparing 4 and 9 , 9 is larger. Thus, the maximum value for the whole list is 9 . Example: Finding a Factorial Let us look at another example of a function before we move on to another topic. Suppose we want to write a function \\(factorial(n)\\) for an integer \\(n\\) ( \\(n \\ge 0\\) ) that computes \\(n!\\) . Recall that \\(n! = n \\times n - 1 \\times n - 2 \\times ... 2 \\times 1 = n \\times (n-1)!\\) . As a special case, \\(0!\\) is defined to be \\(1\\) . The algorithm to do this can be expressed by the following diagram: Let's look at an example. Let's say we want to compute \\(factorial(4)\\) . We assume we know how to solve this for a smaller problem -- \\(factorial(3)\\) , which is 6. \\(factorial(4)\\) is thus 4 \\(\\times\\) 6, i.e., 24. Recursion: Function Calling Itself \\(max'\\) and \\(factorial\\) are examples of functions that calls itself to solve a simpler version of the problem. This is known as recursion . We will revisit this concept in much greater detail in the later part of CS1010. Problem Set Problem 3.1 : Getting MAD The mean absolute deviation, or MAD, of a set of integers measures how spread out a set of data is. The absolute deviation is the absolute difference between an element in the list with the mean of values of the list. The mean absolute deviation is the mean of all the absolute difference. In other words, given \\(L = \\{l_0, ... l_{k-1}\\}\\) , the MAD of \\(L\\) is: \\[\\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} |l_i - \\mu|}{k}\\] How do you find MAD by composing various functions we have seen? Do you need a new function? Problem 3.2 : Ownself calls ownself (a) Give an algorithm for finding the sum of all the integers in the list \\(L\\) with \\(k\\) ( \\(k > 0\\) ) integers that is recursive. (b) The function \\(pow(i, j)\\) computes \\(i^j\\) . Give an algorithm to compute \\(pow(i, j)\\) recursively.

By wishful thinking, we assume that we already know how to solve smaller (as in a shorter list) problem -- \\(max'(L, i+1, j)\\) , so the maximum value for the range of \\(l_i, ..., l_j\\) is the larger of the two: either \\(l_i\\) or \\(max'(L, i+1, j)\\) . We can express this algorithm as follows: Let's trace through the algorithm above, using our previous example: 4 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 . Given this list, we compare the first element, 4 , with the maximum of the rest of the list 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 . Since with wishful thinking, we know how to solve this already, we get 9 as the maximum value of 1 -4 0 9 9 3 5 8 . Comparing 4 and 9 , 9 is larger.

Bits and Bytes Recall from Unit 1 that machine code and data manipulated by machine code are all stored as a sequence of 1s and 0s in the memory. Each unit of either 1 or 0 is known as a bit . 8 bits form a byte . Remember from Unit 2 that a variable is a memory location that stores a value, as a sequence of bits. The bits stored in the memory has no meaning by itself. It has to be interpreted by the machine code. Does a sequence of 1s and 0s represent an integer? A pixel of an image? A sound sample in an audio clip? A month? As a programmer, we have to tag the variable with its type , so that the machine code knows how to interpret the sequence of bits. In addition, the type also tells the machine code, how many bits \"belong\" to this variable. The number of bits of a type is also known as the size of a type. The size of a type determines how many different values a variable of that type can hold. For instance, a type of one bit can only hold two possible values (e.g., 0 or 1 , true or false , black or white ). A type of two bits can hold four values, represented as 00 , 01 , 10 , 11 . In general, a type of \\(k\\) bits can hold \\(2^k\\) values. Integers To represent integers, a type of 8 bits can represent 256 different values. If the type only represents non-negative integers (called unsigned ), then it can hold any value between 0 to 255. If it represents both positive and negative integers (called signed ), it can hold any value between -128 to 127. Depending on the needs (how much memory we have, how big is the number we need to represent), programmers have to decide on the size of the type used for a variable in their programs. With 64 bits, a signed integer can store any value between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. This might look big enough for you -- but we can't even fit the results from \\(factorial(21)\\) here! We have to go to 128 bits to represent larger integers. Characters To represent a character (i.e., a symbol representing a letter, number, punctuation, etc), we use 8 bits for English characters. The ASCII standard maps 127 binary sequences to common characters you can type on your keyboard (including 0-9, A-Z, a-z, all sorts of punctuations: <>?:\"{}!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]\\';/., and special characters like return and escape). The Unicode standard uses up to 32 bits per character, allowing many non-English letter characters (e.g., Emoticons , Braille , Mahjong Tiles ) to be represented. Real Numbers For real numbers, because we need to represent a huge number of possible values, we normally use 32 bits or 64 bits. In CS1231, you will learn that there are uncountably many possible real numbers. But, no matter how many bits we use, we can only represent a finite number of possible values for real numbers. Here, we run into a limit of digitizing information into 0s and 1s -- we can never represent all possible real numbers in a computer! Because of this, programs that manipulate real numbers leads to weird answers (such as 3.1 + 3.2 becomes 3.3000000000000003 ) and so, we have to take special care when dealing with real numbers when writing programs (not just in C, but in many other languages as well). Hence, if we only expect a variable to hold an integer, we should not choose a type that represents real numbers . The details of how a sequence of bits can represent integers and real numbers (both positive and negative numbers) are covered in CS2100. You should have also noticed that in the discussion above, we talk about types that are 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 bits -- all power of twos. We do not have a type of size, say, 41 bits. The reason for this has to do with how memory location is addressed. This will again be explained in CS2100. Type Declaration In C, which we will use in CS1010, we have to associate every variable with a type, and once a variable is declared with a type, the type cannot be changed. This behavior is known as static typing. Some programming languages, such as Javascript and Python, are dynamically typed. The type of a variable may change depending on the value the variable is assigned to. When we write a function, we have to declare the types of each of the parameters and the return value as well. Take the function \\(mean(L, k)\\) as an example. We have said that \\(L\\) is a list 1 of integers. So each element in \\(L\\) should have an integer type (how many bits to use will depend on the range of numbers we want the program to possibly handle and how frugal we are about memory usage). What about \\(k\\) ? \\(k\\) refers to the number of elements in \\(L\\) , so it has to be an integer. As for the value returned by \\(mean(L, k)\\) , even when the inputs are all integers (and thus, the sum is an integer), the mean value can be a real number. So we should choose a type that represents a real number for the return value. Importance of Type Choosing the wrong type to represent a variable can lead to buggy code. Suppose we say that \\(mean(L, k)\\) returns an integer, then when we call \\(mean\\) on the input 1 2 3 4 , we will get 2 as the answer, instead of 2.5 as it should. We have not talked about how to represent a list yet. I will do that in a later unit. \u21a9","title":"4.

You have already learned, conceptually, what is a variable, what is a type and what is a function. Let's see how we apply these concepts to C. To start, let's look at a simple snippet of C code: 1 2 3 4 int square ( int x ) { return x * x ; } The code above defines a function named square . The word int appears before the name square . int is used to signify an integer type. Appearing before the name square tells the compiler that square is returning a value of type int . After the word square , we write the parameters to the function in parenthesis ( and ) . In between ( and ) is int x : x is the name of the parameter, int is the type of that parameter. To summarize, in Line 1, int square(int x) defines a function named square that takes in an integer parameter x and is returning a value which is also an integer. The next three lines are written in between curly brackets { and } . You will see these used a lot in C and other programming languages with C-like syntaxes, such as Javascript, C++, and Java. These curly brackets group a block of statements together. In this example, this block defines how the function square computes the square of x , and what it returns. This is sometimes called the body of a function . In this function body, there is only one statement return x*x; within the block. A statement is a unit in a programming language that expresses either a command to be executed or declares a new variable or function. The word return says that this function square should return the following value, computed as x*x ( x multiply by x ). This statement is terminated by a semicolon ; . You also see that the line that starts with return is indented. We use indentation extensively to indicate the body of a block. Since we can have nested blocks, indentation makes our code easier to read and understand. The words int and return that appear above are keywords defined in the C programming language, and they are reserved for the special meaning that they represent (a type and a command to return a value from a function). We cannot repurpose keywords in C. For instance, we cannot introduce a variable called int . We are now ready to write our first C program. The first program computes the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with a base of 4 and height of 3. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 int square ( int x ) { return x * x ; } int main () { int hypotenuse_square ; hypotenuse_square = square ( 3 ) + square ( 4 ); return 0 ; } Remember that a C program consists of a bunch of functions, calling each other. The most important function is called main , and it is the entry point to the program. It is where the operating system will begin to execute the program. Every program must define exactly one function called main . 1 2 3 4 int main () { : } main returns an integer to the operating system, to signal to the operating system whether the program exits successfully or not. In this case, we always return 0 (success) assuming that nothing goes wrong for simplicity. This is the second example where you see the keyword return in action. In modern C, the main always return 0 when it exits. So, we will skip this statement return 0; from now on. Variable Declaration In the example above, you also see the lines 1 int hypotenuse_square ; This is declaration statement (terminated with a semicolon, again). Each statement declares a variable with its corresponding type ( int here). We gave each variable a name, here we call the variable hypotenuse_square . Remember that all variables must be declared with its corresponding type before used in C . In C, a function must be either defined or declared before used as well. In the example above, we define square before main . If we switch the order of the two, the compiler will complain. Unless we declare the function first. Declaring a function means that we simply state the return type, the name, and the parameters, without the body. Here is an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 int square ( int x ); // declaring the function square int main () { int hypotenuse_square ; hypotenuse_square = square ( 3 ) + square ( 4 ); return 0 ; } int square ( int x ) // defining the function square { return x * x ; } Assignment Statement The next line of the code shows an example of an assignment statement. 1 hypotenuse_square = square ( 3 ) + square ( 4 ); An assignment operator takes the form of: 1 left_hand_side = right_hand_side ; The left_hand_side must be the name of a variable. We first evaluate the right_hand_side of the assignment statement, find its value, then put the value into the variable named on the left_hand_side . Here, on the right-hand side, we call the function square , which we defined earlier. We call square with arguments 3 and 4 respectively. We use the operator + to add the two results together. The right-hand side should give the value 25, which we then assign to the variable hypotenuse_square . Note that we use = equal sign for assignment, NOT for checking equality. The C notation for checking for equality is == (we will come back to this later). Recap Before we move on, let's recap some concepts: A C program consists of functions, invoking each other. Each function is defined by its returned type, followed by its name, its parameter(s) (within a pair of parenthesis) and its body (within a pair of curly brackets). Each function must be defined or declared before it is used. The function body consists of one or more statements. We have seen assignment statements (using the = operator) and return statements, using return as the keyword. Each variable must be declared before it is used. A declaration starts with its type followed by its name. Example 2 Let's change the program slightly, so that instead of computing the square of the hypotenuse, we compute the hypotenuse itself. Recall that we said C provides a bunch of predefined functions, include sqrt , which computes the square root of a given number. Since a square root of a number is not necessarily an integer, we need to use a variable with a type that can store a real number. To represent real numbers, we commonly use the type float (which is short for a floating point number -- named so due to how a real number is represented in bits). A float type can store 32 bits. To double the precision (64 bits), we can use the type double . A long double type can store either 80-bits or 128-bits, depending on the implementation. But which one does sqrt returns? To find out the exact specification of a pre-defined function, we can consult the manual (or man for short) pages for the function. If you type man sqrt on the command line (or place the cursor on sqrt in vim and type K in command mode), you will see that the sqrt method has the following specification: 1 double sqrt ( double x ); The sqrt function returns a double precision real number. We can now modify the program above to the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 double sqrt ( double x ); // not recommended long square ( long x ) { return x * x ; } double hypotenuse_of ( long base , long height ) { return sqrt ( square ( base ) + square ( height )); } int main () { hypotenuse_of ( 3 , 4 ); } Note that the first line declares the function sqrt , because we need to declare a function before it is used. Since sqrt is pre-defined elsewhere, we do not have to supply the function body here. Such practice of declaring a predefined function ourselves, however, is not recommended. Different platform, compilers, libraries, may provide a different specification for the same function. As such, it is better to use the declaration from the library that provides the predefined function itself. A library usually provides one or more header files , a set of files that contain function declarations, type definitions, and constant definitions. In the case of sqrt , its declaration is contained in a header file called math.h (which we found out through consulting the man pages). To include this file, you add the line #include <math.h> at the top of the program. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 #include <math.h> long square ( long x ) { return x * x ; } double hypotenuse_of ( long base , long height ) { return sqrt ( square ( base ) + square ( height )); } int main () { hypotenuse_of ( 3 , 4 ); } You might notice the same line appear in the man page for sqrt . Thus, the man pages tell us which header file to include if you want to use a certain function. File Extension The convention for file extension for a C program is .c and for a C header file is .h . Even though you are allowed to name the files with any extension you like, you should stick to the convention so that it is clear to other tools/programmers what is the purpose of each file. Other Types in C An int variable is usually 32-bits long. If we only need 16 bits, we use the type short int , or just short . If we only need 8-bits, we use the type char (short for character). Note that in the above, I said an int is usually 32 bits. Remember (from Unit 1 that a C program gets compiled into machine code for a specific CPU architecture. The C standard only guarantees that an int is at least 16 bits. Although most C compilers compile int to 32 bits, there is no guarantee! If we need something more than an int , we can use long int , or just long . The C standard guarantees that a long is at least 32 bits. Depending on the implementation, it sometimes compiled to 32-bits, sometimes 64-bits. To get even longer, we can use the type long long int , or just long long , which is guaranteed to be at least 64 bits 1 . Signed vs. Unsigned We have seen earlier that the same sequence of bits, if interpreted as signed or unsigned, would result in a different value. By default, all types in C refer to signed types. If you want a variable that holds only non-negative integers, you can add the keyword unsigned to the front of the type. Doing so would mean that the range of values you can store in the variable is doubled, without adding more bits (since the bit used to present the + or - sign is no longer needed). For instance, since we know that square can only return a non-zero integer, we can actually declare it as: 1 2 3 4 unsigned long square ( long x ) { return x * x ; } For most practical purposes in CS1010, a (signed) long suffices. We introduce the notion of signed vs. unsigned for your information so that you know what they are when you come across them in others source code. Mixing signed and unsigned can lead to subtle bugs in your code. As such, we will only use signed long for CS1010 . You may choose to use them appropriately in another context, especially for embedded system or low-level programming. Unsigned Real Numbers? There are no unsigned versions of float and double . To understand the reason, we have to go further into how floating points numbers are represented in bits. That is a topic for another module. stdint.h Since the number of bits for int , long , and long long could differ, in order to write a C program that is portable (i.e., works on different platforms, architecture, operating systems), we have two options: Do not write a program that assumes a specific number of bits is used for a certain type, or Use the type defined in the header file stdint.h : int8_t , uint8_t , int16_t , uint16_t , int32_t , uint32_t , int64_t , uint64_t . The suffix _t is a convention to indicate that this is a customized type (more on this in later units). The prefix u indicates that the type is an unsigned type. The numbers 8 , 16 , 32 , and 64 indicate the number of bits for each type. Thus, uint32_t is guaranteed to be of size 32 bits, and can hold unsigned integer values from \\(0\\) to \\(2^{32}-1\\) . Problem Set 5 Problem 5.1 In the example above, sqrt is declared to take in a parameter of type double . But the argument that we pass in is the sum of two int , which is also an int . Would this result in an error? Problem 5.2 Consider the following alternative definition of square 1 2 3 ??? square ( uint16_t x ) { return x * x ; } What should the return type of this square be, in order for the return type to be big enough to store all possible value for x*x ? Adding more long does not make the integer longer, i.e., there is no long long long int . \u21a9","title":"Unit 5: First C Program"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#unit-5-first-c-program","text":"In this unit, we will write and compile your first C program.

The first program computes the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with a base of 4 and height of 3. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 int square ( int x ) { return x * x ; } int main () { int hypotenuse_square ; hypotenuse_square = square ( 3 ) + square ( 4 ); return 0 ; } Remember that a C program consists of a bunch of functions, calling each other. The most important function is called main , and it is the entry point to the program. It is where the operating system will begin to execute the program. Every program must define exactly one function called main . 1 2 3 4 int main () { : } main returns an integer to the operating system, to signal to the operating system whether the program exits successfully or not. In this case, we always return 0 (success) assuming that nothing goes wrong for simplicity. This is the second example where you see the keyword return in action. In modern C, the main always return 0 when it exits. So, we will skip this statement return 0; from now on.","title":"Unit 5: First C Program"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#variable-declaration","text":"In the example above, you also see the lines 1 int hypotenuse_square ; This is declaration statement (terminated with a semicolon, again). Each statement declares a variable with its corresponding type ( int here). We gave each variable a name, here we call the variable hypotenuse_square . Remember that all variables must be declared with its corresponding type before used in C . In C, a function must be either defined or declared before used as well. In the example above, we define square before main . If we switch the order of the two, the compiler will complain. Unless we declare the function first. Declaring a function means that we simply state the return type, the name, and the parameters, without the body. Here is an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 int square ( int x ); // declaring the function square int main () { int hypotenuse_square ; hypotenuse_square = square ( 3 ) + square ( 4 ); return 0 ; } int square ( int x ) // defining the function square { return x * x ; }","title":"Variable Declaration"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#assignment-statement","text":"The next line of the code shows an example of an assignment statement. 1 hypotenuse_square = square ( 3 ) + square ( 4 ); An assignment operator takes the form of: 1 left_hand_side = right_hand_side ; The left_hand_side must be the name of a variable. We first evaluate the right_hand_side of the assignment statement, find its value, then put the value into the variable named on the left_hand_side . Here, on the right-hand side, we call the function square , which we defined earlier. We call square with arguments 3 and 4 respectively. We use the operator + to add the two results together. The right-hand side should give the value 25, which we then assign to the variable hypotenuse_square . Note that we use = equal sign for assignment, NOT for checking equality. The C notation for checking for equality is == (we will come back to this later).","title":"Assignment Statement"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#recap","text":"Before we move on, let's recap some concepts: A C program consists of functions, invoking each other. Each function is defined by its returned type, followed by its name, its parameter(s) (within a pair of parenthesis) and its body (within a pair of curly brackets). Each function must be defined or declared before it is used. The function body consists of one or more statements. We have seen assignment statements (using the = operator) and return statements, using return as the keyword. Each variable must be declared before it is used. A declaration starts with its type followed by its name.","title":"Recap"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#example-2","text":"Let's change the program slightly, so that instead of computing the square of the hypotenuse, we compute the hypotenuse itself. Recall that we said C provides a bunch of predefined functions, include sqrt , which computes the square root of a given number. Since a square root of a number is not necessarily an integer, we need to use a variable with a type that can store a real number. To represent real numbers, we commonly use the type float (which is short for a floating point number -- named so due to how a real number is represented in bits). A float type can store 32 bits. To double the precision (64 bits), we can use the type double . A long double type can store either 80-bits or 128-bits, depending on the implementation. But which one does sqrt returns? To find out the exact specification of a pre-defined function, we can consult the manual (or man for short) pages for the function. If you type man sqrt on the command line (or place the cursor on sqrt in vim and type K in command mode), you will see that the sqrt method has the following specification: 1 double sqrt ( double x ); The sqrt function returns a double precision real number. We can now modify the program above to the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 double sqrt ( double x ); // not recommended long square ( long x ) { return x * x ; } double hypotenuse_of ( long base , long height ) { return sqrt ( square ( base ) + square ( height )); } int main () { hypotenuse_of ( 3 , 4 ); } Note that the first line declares the function sqrt , because we need to declare a function before it is used. Since sqrt is pre-defined elsewhere, we do not have to supply the function body here. Such practice of declaring a predefined function ourselves, however, is not recommended. Different platform, compilers, libraries, may provide a different specification for the same function. As such, it is better to use the declaration from the library that provides the predefined function itself. A library usually provides one or more header files , a set of files that contain function declarations, type definitions, and constant definitions. In the case of sqrt , its declaration is contained in a header file called math.h (which we found out through consulting the man pages). To include this file, you add the line #include <math.h> at the top of the program. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 #include <math.h> long square ( long x ) { return x * x ; } double hypotenuse_of ( long base , long height ) { return sqrt ( square ( base ) + square ( height )); } int main () { hypotenuse_of ( 3 , 4 ); } You might notice the same line appear in the man page for sqrt . Thus, the man pages tell us which header file to include if you want to use a certain function. File Extension The convention for file extension for a C program is .c and for a C header file is .h . Even though you are allowed to name the files with any extension you like, you should stick to the convention so that it is clear to other tools/programmers what is the purpose of each file.","title":"Example 2"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#other-types-in-c","text":"An int variable is usually 32-bits long. If we only need 16 bits, we use the type short int , or just short . If we only need 8-bits, we use the type char (short for character). Note that in the above, I said an int is usually 32 bits. Remember (from Unit 1 that a C program gets compiled into machine code for a specific CPU architecture. The C standard only guarantees that an int is at least 16 bits. Although most C compilers compile int to 32 bits, there is no guarantee! If we need something more than an int , we can use long int , or just long . The C standard guarantees that a long is at least 32 bits. Depending on the implementation, it sometimes compiled to 32-bits, sometimes 64-bits. To get even longer, we can use the type long long int , or just long long , which is guaranteed to be at least 64 bits 1 .","title":"Other Types in C"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#signed-vs-unsigned","text":"We have seen earlier that the same sequence of bits, if interpreted as signed or unsigned, would result in a different value. By default, all types in C refer to signed types. If you want a variable that holds only non-negative integers, you can add the keyword unsigned to the front of the type. Doing so would mean that the range of values you can store in the variable is doubled, without adding more bits (since the bit used to present the + or - sign is no longer needed). For instance, since we know that square can only return a non-zero integer, we can actually declare it as: 1 2 3 4 unsigned long square ( long x ) { return x * x ; } For most practical purposes in CS1010, a (signed) long suffices. We introduce the notion of signed vs. unsigned for your information so that you know what they are when you come across them in others source code. Mixing signed and unsigned can lead to subtle bugs in your code. As such, we will only use signed long for CS1010 . You may choose to use them appropriately in another context, especially for embedded system or low-level programming. Unsigned Real Numbers? There are no unsigned versions of float and double . To understand the reason, we have to go further into how floating points numbers are represented in bits. That is a topic for another module.","title":"Signed vs. Unsigned"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#stdinth","text":"Since the number of bits for int , long , and long long could differ, in order to write a C program that is portable (i.e., works on different platforms, architecture, operating systems), we have two options: Do not write a program that assumes a specific number of bits is used for a certain type, or Use the type defined in the header file stdint.h : int8_t , uint8_t , int16_t , uint16_t , int32_t , uint32_t , int64_t , uint64_t . The suffix _t is a convention to indicate that this is a customized type (more on this in later units). The prefix u indicates that the type is an unsigned type. The numbers 8 , 16 , 32 , and 64 indicate the number of bits for each type. Thus, uint32_t is guaranteed to be of size 32 bits, and can hold unsigned integer values from \\(0\\) to \\(2^{32}-1\\) .","title":"stdint.h"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#problem-set-5","text":"","title":"Problem Set 5"},{"location":"05-first-c.html#problem-51","text":"In the example above, sqrt is declared to take in a parameter of type double .

The value to be computed is hard-coded, and the result computed is not displayed. To make this program more general and useful, first, we need to compute the hypotenuse for any length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle. We cannot hardcode the length in the program. We should read these values from the users. Second, we need to output the result of the computation to the users. In other words, to make the program more general and useful, we need to add input and output, or I/O, functions. Standard Input and Standard Output Before we talk about how to read the input values and display the output values, we have to first talk about where an input comes from and where an output goes to. In UNIX-flavored operating systems, an input is read from an abstract channel called the standard input , or stdin for short, and an output is sent to an abstract channel called the standard output , or stdout for short. The fact that these channels are abstract is a powerful concept -- when we write our code, we do not have to worry about where the inputs come from and where the outputs go to. It will depend on how the user runs our program. Thus, it allows the users of our program the flexibility to control where the data comes from or goes to. For instance, the standard input, by default, reads from the keyboard. But the user can choose to read from a file, using the redirection < operator from the command line or from the output of another process, using the pipe | operator from the command line . Similarly, the standard output, by default, writes to the terminal. But the user can choose to write to a file using the redirection > operator on the command line or to the input of another process, using the pipe | operator, again, on the command line when invoking the program. You will see how cool these are later. But for the purpose of C programming, it suffices to know for now that we only need to read from stdin and write to stdout in our code, and we let the users decide where they come from / go to. No printf and scanf (yet) In almost all articles and textbooks on C that I have seen, the scanf and printf functions are taught as the standard C library functions to perform the input and output respectively. The function scanf , however, is tricky to use correctly and securely. The function printf comes with many nuances, such as remembering the different conversion specifiers and modifiers. I would rather not teach you scanf and printf at this stage.

On Lines 17 and 18, we introduce two new long variables named base and height , which we initialized with the returned value from cs1010_read_long() . The function cs1010_read_long reads a long value from stdin and returns the value. For now, we assume that the inputs are correctly passed to the program.

Compile a standalone C program Suppose we have a standalone C program teh.c that does not use any external libraries. We can compile the program using the command 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang teh.c This command should create an executable called a.out in the current directory, which you can then run with: 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ ./a.out 2. Renaming executable file The name a.out is an abbreviation for assembler output , a name that many compilers kept as the default output name since the 60s. We should, however, give our executable more descriptive name, by using the -o flag. ( o is the mnemonic for output). 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang teh.c -o teh or 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang -o teh teh.c The command above would create an executable called teh . Beware of the order If you are not careful and run the following command instead: 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang -o teh.c teh clang would overwrite your code teh.c -- all your hard work will be gone!! 3. Warning for possible bugs. The clang checks for syntax errors in your C files -- i.e., things that violate the C syntax rules. The compiler, however, is smart enough to identify possible bugs -- errors that will cause your program to behave incorrectly, even if the syntax follows C's rules. You can ask clang to warn you about this, using the -W flag ( W is the mnemonic for warning -- note the capital W). The manual for clang lists different types of warnings that clang can warn you about. For simplicity, we will ask clang to warn us about everything, by enabling all warnings. The command to do so is: 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang -Wall teh.c -o teh For beginners, it is highly recommended that you always compile with -Wall flag. 4. Generating additional information for debugging. In order to use the debugger lldb to trace through and debug your program, clang needs to generate additional information and store them in the executable file. We can instruct clang to generate them with the flag -g ( g for generate). 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang -Wall -g teh.c -o teh It is recommended that you always compile with -g flags during the development phase. If you need to measure the performance (e.g., how fast it runs) of your program or when you are releasing the program to the public, you can remove the -g flag and compile with the optimization flags (e.g., -O ) instead. 5. Linking with the standard library. To link with a standard library, we use the -l flag to specify the name of the library to link. For instance, to link with the C standard math library (abbreviated as m ), you issue the command: 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang -Wall -g teh.c -o teh -lm 6. Linking with 3rd party library By default, clang looks for headers and libraries in the systems directories ( /usr/include , /usr/lib , etc) and the current working directory. If you use a third-party library, you usually need to tell clang where to look for the corresponding headers and libraries. You can use the -I flag and the -L flag for these purposes. For instance, if you have a library installed under your home called citadel , and the file citadel.h can be found under ~/citadel/include and the file libcitadel.a can be found under ~/citadel/lib , to tell clang where to find these files, you can compile with: 1 ooiwt@pe118:~$ clang -Wall -g -I ~/citadel/include -L ~/citadel/lib teh.c -o teh -lm -lcitadel","title":"CLang"},{"location":"clang.html#cs1010-compilation-guide","text":"","title":"CS1010 Compilation Guide"},{"location":"clang.html#1-compile-a-standalone-c-program","text":"Suppose we have a standalone C program teh.c that does not use any external libraries.

Wikipedia lists more than 40 different C compilers . These different compilers support different processor architecture, operating systems, may behave slightly differently, and may support different features of C standards. It is therefore important for CS1010 to stick to a single platform and single compiler. Our platform of choice is Ubuntu 18.04 (or later) using the clang compiler ( version 6.0 or later ). The school has provided a list of computing servers for you to use. You can access them remotely via ssh , or secure shell. The hosts are named pe111 , pe112 , ... , pe120 . ( pe stands for \"programming environment\"). We will refer to these servers generally as the PE hosts. pe115 and pe116 For this semester, the two servers pe115 and pe116 are not available. You can choose which of the 10 8 hosts to use. You share the same home directory across all the hosts (this home directory, however, is different from that of sunfire ). For simplicity, the following guide uses pe111 in all examples. Do keep in mind that you can use other hosts for CS1010 to spread out the load. While it is possible for you to complete the programming assignments on your own computers, the practical exams are done in a controlled environment using servers similar to the PE hosts. It is therefore advisable for you to familiarize yourself with accessing the PE servers via ssh and edit your program with either vim . Basic Requirements You need to have an SoC UNIX account. If you do not have one, you can apply for one online . Once you have an account, you need to activate your access to the PE hosts , which is part of the SoC computer clusters. You need an ssh client. macOS and Linux users should already have it installed by default. Windows 10 users should install the Windows Subsystem for Linux and use Linux. For older versions of Windows, such as those used in the SoC's programming labs, you can check out XShell 6 (free for home/school use), or PuTTY . These are GUI-based programs so the command lines instructions below do not apply. The Command to SSH Run: 1 ssh <username>@pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg Replace <username> with your SoC UNIX username, for instance, I would do: 1 ssh ooiwt@pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg After the command above, following the instructions on the screen. The first time you ever connect to pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg , you will be warned that you are connecting to a previously unknown host. Say yes , and you will be prompted with your SoC UNIX password. Accessing The PE Hosts from Outside SoC The PE hosts can only be accessed from within the School of Computing networks. If you want to access it from outside, there are several ways. Option 1: Using SoC VPN One way is to set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) (See instruction here ). The staff at helpdesk@comp.nus.edu.sg or the IT helpdesk in COM1, Level 1, will be able to help with you setting up if needed. SoC VPN vs NUS VPN Note that SoC VPN is different from NUS VPN. Connecting to NUS VPN only allows you access to the NUS internal network, but not the SoC internal network. Windows 10 Users: FortiClient from Windows Store Students have reported that running FortiClient downloaded from the Windows Store does not allow one to ssh from WSL to sunfire as expected. Therefore, you should download and install For Windows 10 users, please download and install FortiClient VPN directly from FortiClient's website . Option 2: Tunneling through Sunfire The alternative is to use ssh tunnels. SoC's Sunfire ( sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg ) is configured to allow your connection if it's originating from a local telco (See more details here ). There are two ways to achieve this, and in both ways, it appears to the PE hosts that Sunfire is the client. SSH through sunfire Connect to sunfire at sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg via command line ssh with the option -t . 1 ssh -t sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg ssh pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg Alternatively: 1 ssh pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg -J sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg SSH Port Forwarding SSH has built-in support for local and remote port forwarding, and local port forwarding can be used to connect to the programming environments. Local port forwarding means that a port of the SSH client (your machine) is forwarded to the SSH server ( sunfire ), which opens a connection to a preset destination server (e.g., pe111 ). This method causes the host to seem as if it is hosted on a local port, e.g. localhost:7000 , allowing you to use your favorite SCP program (e.g. FileZilla ) to access the PE host. To use local port forwarding (from local port 7000 ), connect to sunfire using 1 ssh -L 7000:pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg:22 <username>@sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg This command opens an SSH tunnel from port 7000 of your machine to port 22 (the default SSH port) of pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg via sunfire . After successful login, open a separate SSH (or SCP) connection from your machine to localhost at port 7000 to access the PE host: 1 ssh <username>@localhost -p 7000 PuTTY supports SSH port forwarding, so this setup can also be used on Windows. Setting up SSH Keys Once you are comfortable with UNIX, you can set up a pair of public/private keys for authentication. You can use 1 ssh-keygen -t rsa to generate a pair of keys on your local computer. Keep the private key id_rsa on your local machine in the hidden ~/.ssh directory, and copy the public key id_rsa.pub to your home directory on PE pe111 . On pe111 , run 1 cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Make sure that the permission for .ssh both on the local machine and on PE are set to 700 and the files id_rsa on the local machine and authorized_keys on the remote machine are set to 600 . Once set up, you need not enter your password every time you run ssh or scp . Troubleshooting Suppose you try to connect to pe111 using either: 1 2 3 ssh pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg ssh -t sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg ssh pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg ssh pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg -J sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg and you get the following error: ssh: Could not resolve hostname pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg ssh cannot recognize the name pe111 , it is likely that you are not connected to the SoC VPN.

An exercise is something that you do on your own. You can submit them but it will not be graded. Test cases are provided for the exercises so that you can test and check on your own if your code is correct. This is in contrast to an assignment, where you need to submit for grading and credits. Prerequisite You are able to access the CS1010 programming environment . You are familiar with basic UNIX CLI and using terminal-based editor vim . Learning Outcomes Be comfortable writing simple C programs that involve arithmetic operations, long and double types, and standard I/O. One-Time Setup Before going into their first programming exercise, you need to do a one-time setup of your account on PE. You need to create a file called .gitconfig in your home directory and with the following content: 1 2 3 4 5 [user] name = Your Name email = Your Email [github] user = Your GitHub ID Your email should be whatever you used to sign up Github. For example, a sample .gitconfig looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 [user] name = Elsa email = queen@arendelle.gov [github] user = elsasnow16 After saving this file, run: 1 git config --get github.user It should return your GitHub user id. It should print your GitHub user id as already set. If there is a typo, you need to edit .gitconfig again and reload it by repeating the command above. Setup Click on this link to accept the exercise. Log in to one of the hosts of CS1010 programming environment (PE) Run the following on the command line on one of the PE hosts: 1 ~cs1010/get-ex00 You should see a new subdirectory ex00-<githubid> in your current working directory, where githubid is your GitHub ID. We will call this directory your exercise directory or assignment directory . Inside that directory, you should see a bunch of files: echo.c , divide.c , and quadratic.c are the most important files. They are the skeleton C code that you should edit to solve the exercise. inputs and outputs are subdirectories that contain test inputs and test outputs. We use the convention problem-name . test-id .in for input test data, and problem-name . test-id .out for output test data. So, you will see echo.1.in , divide.1.out , etc. The expected output for echo.1.in is in echo.1.out . You can look at the content of these files if you wish (which UNIX command should you use to do this?). You can edit these files to change the test input and output. Makefile : The configuration for the tool make that we use to automate the compilation and testing of the programs. You do not have to understand how to write a Makefile for CS1010. If you are interested to learn how to write a Makefile , talk to either Wei Tsang or Google. test.sh : A bash script for testing your code. You do not have to edit this file nor call it directly. It is invoked by make . If you are interested to learn how to write bash script, talk to either Wei Tsang or Google. Identifying Yourself In every C file that you submit to CS1010, you need to identify yourself by writing your name and tutorial group. Marks will be deducted if you fail to do so. You need to edit the line: 1 @author XXXX (Group YYYY) and change it to something like: 1 @author Elsa of Arendelle (Group B10) Solving The Assignments Edit the files echo.c , divide.c , and quadratic.c to solve the corresponding question as described below. To compile and run the given tests with the sample inputs and outputs, run on the command line, 1 make This command will compile both C files. If there is no compilation error, it will run the test scripts. Submission When you are ready, run the following command while you are in the exercise directory: 1 ~cs1010/submit-ex00 The files add.c , divide.c , and quadratic.c will be uploaded to GitHub. You can submit multiple times. Grading This assignment is not graded. Question 1: Echo Write a program echo (source file echo.c ) that reads in an integer and print that integer to the standard output. Sample run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./echo 123 123 ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./echo -1 -1 The text ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ is the command prompt. Yours will look different, of course. echo is the executable you created. The next line, 123 , is the input you provide. Press enter after the input. 123 is the output printed by echo . Question 2: Divide Write a program divide (source file divide.c ) that reads in two integers, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) , and print the value of \\(x\\) divided by \\(y\\) . You can assume that \\(y\\) is never 0. Sample run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./divide 10 2 5.0000 ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./divide 1 2 0.5000 Question 3: Quadratic Write a program quadratic (source file quadratic.c ) that reads in three integers, \\(a\\) , \\(b\\) , and \\(c\\) , that represent the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) , and prints its two roots. Assume that \\(a \\not = 0\\) and \\(b^2 > 4ac\\) . Recall that the roots are: $$ \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ Print the root \\(\\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) first on one line, followed by the other root \\(\\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) on the next line.

We will expand this list over the semester. How to Read the Messages clang messages always start with the name of the file, the line number, and the character position. For instance, 1 error.c:3:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'x' shows the error in the file error.c , line 3, position 5. In vim , you can use :<line number> to jump directly to the line containing this error. List of Errors and Warnings Variables E1. Use of undeclared identifier C is a statically type language, and thus every variable used must be declared with its type. E.g., 1 2 3 4 int main () { x = 0 ; } would lead to the error 1 2 3 x.c:3:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'x' x = 0; ^ In the example above, x is used by not declared. To fix, declare x with its type. E.g., 1 2 3 4 int main () { long x = 0 ; } E2. Redefinition of a variable Each variable should be declared exactly once within its scope (scoped by { and } ). E.g., 1 2 3 4 5 int main () { long x = 0 ; long x = 1 ; } Would give the error 1 2 3 4 5 6 x.c:4:10: error: redefinition of 'x' long x = 1; ^ x.c:3:10: note: previous definition is here long x = 0; ^ To fix, check whether you intend the second declaration to be the same variable (in which case, remove the declaration) or a new one (in which case, give it a different name). W. Unused Variable Declaring variables that are not used clutter the code. It is a good programming practice to only declare the variables that you need. CS1010 insists on this. If you declare variables that you end up not using, you will be penalized. 1 2 3 4 int main () { long x = 1 ; } Would result in 1 2 3 x.c:4:10: warning: unused variable 'x' [-Wunused-variable] long x = 1; ^ To fix, go through all such warnings and remove any variables that you declared/initialized but never used. Functions W. Type specifier missing Functions must have a return type declared. C, by default, treats all functions as returning int if the return type is not declared. It is, however, a good programming practice to always declare the return type explicitly, even if it is returning int . CS1010 insists on this and you will be penalized if you do not declare the return type. E.g., 1 2 3 main () { } would give the warning 1 2 3 x.c:1:1: warning: type specifier missing, defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int] main() ^ W. Implicit declaration of function All functions in C must be declared before they are used. If the function is defined elsewhere, the header file containing the function declaration should be included. Without the function declaration, the compile will guess the type of the arguments and its return type. An incorrect guess would lead to buggy code and thus should be avoided. E.g., 1 2 3 4 main () { sqrt ( 4 ); } would give the warning 1 2 3 4 x.c:3:4: warning: implicitly declaring library function 'sqrt' with type 'double (double)' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration] sqrt(4); ^ To fix, include the appropriate header file. E. Undefined reference to a function This error is usually accompanied by an \"implicit declaration of function\" warning. During linking, clang tries to locate the definition of a function. Calling a function that is not defined would lead to the error above. E.g., 1 2 3 int main () { foo (); } would give the error: 1 2 3 /tmp/x-edd854.o: In function `main': x.c:(.text+0xb): undefined reference to `foo' clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)u E. Too many/few arguments to function call Each function should be called with exactly the number of arguments defined. E.g., 1 2 3 4 5 #include <math.h> int main () { sqrt (); } would lead to: 1 2 3 x.c:4:10: error: too few arguments to function call, single argument '__x' was not specified sqrt(); ~~~~ ^ To fix, check the documentation or the man page of the function you are calling to understand the number of arguments needed. W. Control reaches end of non-void function Every non-void function, with the exception of main , must return a value. If you define a non-void function but did not include a return statement, the compiler would warn you. Failing the return the intended value means the caller would not receive the correct value back, leading to buggy code. E.g., 1 2 3 int foo () { } would lead to the warning: 1 2 x.c:3:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type] }","title":"Common `clang` Errors and Warnings"},{"location":"messages.html#common-clang-errors-and-warnings","text":"Here is the list of common clang errors and warnings that you may enconuter.

If you email us privately and we feel that your questions/answers are useful to the rest of the class, we will publish it on Piazza, with anonymization when appropriate. Lab Sessions Attendance is not compulsory at NUS, but we do take attendance during the tutorial sessions. You should stick to your allocated time slot for tutorials. If there is a strong reason for you to attend another tutorial session, please inform your tutor. Late Submissions All programming assignments must be submitted on time. If you need an extension, please ask for one and provide a justification for approval. Only academic reasons and compassionate reasons can be considered (e.g., representing NUS for a sports event is OK; Attending a wedding is not). For late submission, there is a 1% penalty (of the total assessment grade) for every 5-minutes after the deadline, capped at 80%. For example, if an assessment that was given 40 marks was submitted 100 minutes after the deadline, the student will get 32 marks instead (20% penalty). If it is submitted 10 hours after the deadline, the student will get 8 marks (as the cap of 80% penalty has been reached). Discussions and Plagiarism We encourage discussions among students for programming assignments, but each student should be responsible for writing his/her own code and should give credits to others when appropriate. NUS and School of Computing have a high standard of academic honesty and take any violation seriously. In the context of computing modules, source code plagiarism -- copying code from another source and attributing it as one's own code -- is a serious violation. Please read the page Preventing Plagiarism from the school's website to familiarize yourself with the policy. I adopt a \"no mercy\" policy when it comes to disciplinary action on plagiarism. Both parties, the student who copied, and the student who allowed others to copy, will be penalized equally. Screencast Screencast will be recorded and posted online 3-4 days after the lecture. This will be done on a 'best effort' basis and screencast will not be guaranteed to be available on time or at all. Posting of screencast is meant to help students who attended the lecture to recap the content or to help those who are not able to attend the lecture due to unexpected circumstances. It does not mean that you should skip the lecture. Research has shown that the effect of over-reliance on screencast is negative. Model Solutions and Slides Slides will be posted after the class. Note that slides are used as a visual aid to assist me during the lectures. It is not meant as a summary of lectures nor a replacement of lecture notes. In a module like CS1010, there is often not a single correct answer. Hence, there is no model solution for this module. Sample solutions may be posted (both good and bad ones) for discussion. I strongly encourage students to discuss your solution with the teaching team, instead of just comparing your solution with the sample solution. Grading Students will receive the grades they deserve irrespective of how the other students in the class perform (i.e., no bell curve).

While these tasks can be done through a GUI interface, a command line is still useful because (i) it provides a simple way to interact with a remote system (only text are exchanged between the local and remote hosts instead of graphics); (ii) it is extremely flexible and provides many customization options; (iii) you can easily automate the sequence of commands to issue for repetitive tasks; and (iv) it is faster. Connect to the Programming Environment (PE) If you would like to follow the following examples, you should first ssh into one of the PE hosts provided. We will use pe111 in the following example. But feel free to use pe112 up to pe120 for your practice. You should read this guide to see how to access and connect to the environment. Once you are connected, you should see a prompt like this. 1 ooiwt@pe111:~$ This interface is provided by a UNIX bash -- this shell sits in a loop and waits for users to enter a command, then it interprets and executes the command. There are many versions of shells, the default shell for our PE is bash 1 . The following is adapted for CS1010 from the instructions created by Aaron Tan . Bugs are mine. The power of UNIX stems from the many commands it offers. The following are a few commonly used commands. This list is by no means exhaustive and you are urged to explore on your own. Note that UNIX commands are case-sensitive . All commands are to be entered after the UNIX prompt of the form 1 ooiwt@pe111:~$ ~ indicates that you are currently in your home directory. The following examples assume that user ooiwt is logged into pe111 . It might be good to understand the directory structure in UNIX, a multi-user system. The directory tree is shown below: Each user has his/her own home directory, which is where he/she will be automatically placed when he/she logs in to the system. The above figure shows where the home directory of the user ooiwt resides in the directory tree. The user ooiwt may create files or directories in his/her home directory, but not elsewhere unless permission is given. pwd : Print Current Working directory pwd shows you which directory you are currently in 1 2 ooiwt@pe111:~$ pwd /home/o/ooiwt UNIX uses forward slash / to deliminate different parts of the directory structure. This is the same notation as URLs so you should already be familiar with it. ls : LiSt files The ls list the files in the current working directory. 1 2 ooiwt@pe111:~$ ls ooiwt@pe111:~$ If you do not have any regular files in your home directory, as you should when you first log in, you should immediately return to the bash prompt. Rule of Silence UNIX follows the rule of silence : programs should not print unnecessary output, to allow other programs and users to easily parse the output from one program. So, if ls has nothing to list, it will list nothing (as opposed to, say, printing \"This is an empty directory.\") mkdir : MaKe a subDIRectory The mkdir command creates a subdirectory with the given name in the current directory. 1 2 3 4 5 ooiwt@pe111:~$ mkdir tut01 ooiwt@pe111:~$ ls tut01 ooiwt@pe111:~$ ls -F tut01/ Here, you create a directory called tut01 . Now, when you ls , you can see the directory listed. You may also use ls -F for more information ( -F is one of the many options / flags available for the ls command. To see a complete list of the options, refer to the man pages, i.e., man ls .) The slash / beside the filename tells you that the file is a directory (aka folder in Windows lingo). A normal file does not have a slash beside its name when \"ls -F\" is used. You may also use the ls -l command (hyphen el, not hyphen one) to display almost all the file information, include the size of the file and the date of modification. Use Ctrl + P for Command History Unix maintains a history of your previously executed UNIX commands, and you may use Ctrl + P and Ctrl + N to go through it. Press the Ctrl + P until you find a previously executed UNIX command. You may then press Enter to execute it or edit the command before executing it. This is handy when you need to repeatedly execute a long UNIX command. cd : Change Directory To navigate in the directory tree, changing the current working directory from to another, we use the cd command. 1 2 ooiwt@pe111:~$ cd tut01 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ Note that the prompt changes to ~/tut01 to indicate that you are now in the tut01 directory below your HOME directory. Entering cd alone brings you back to your HOME directory, i.e., the directory in which you started with when you first logged into the system. 1 2 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ cd ooiwt@pe111:~$ Two dots .. refers to the parent directory. So, alternatively, for the case above, since we are only one level down from the HOME , to return home, we can alternatively use cd .. . 1 2 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ cd .. ooiwt@pe111:~$ rmdir : ReMove a subDIRectory rmdir removes a subDIRectory in current directory -- note that a directory must be empty before it can be removed. 1 2 3 4 5 ooiwt@pe111:~$ rmdir tut01 ooiwt@pe111:~$ ls -F ooiwt@pe111:~$ mkdir tut01 ooiwt@pe111:~$ ls -F tut01/ cp : CoPy files 1 2 3 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ cp ~cs1010/tut01/hello.c . ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ ls hello.c The command above copies the file hello.c from the HOME of user cs1010 , under directory tut01 , to the current directory. If you want to copy the whole directory, use -r flag, where r stands for recursive copy. 1 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ cp -r ~cs1010/tut01 . In the last command above, the single . refers to the current directory. The directory tut01 and everything under it will be copied to the current directory. mv : MoVe or rename files mv can move files from one directory to another. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ ls hello.c ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ mv hello.c .. ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ ls ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ ls .. hello.c ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ mv ../hello.c . Here, we tell mv to copy a file hello.c from the parent directory to the current directory. mv can also be used to rename files. 1 2 3 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ mv hello.c hello_world.c ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ ls hello_world.c Use TAB for Name Completion If you have a very long file name, you may use UNIX's filename completion feature to reduce typing. For instance, you may type: 1 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ mv h and press the Tab key, and UNIX will complete the filename for you if there is only one filename with the prefix \"h\". Otherwise, it will fill up the filename to the point where you need to type in more characters for disambiguation. The Tab key can also complete the name of a command. rm : ReMove files Be careful with this command -- files deleted cannot be restored. There is no trash or recycled bin like in Mac or Windows. 1 2 3 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ rm hello.c ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ ls ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ rm -rf * While Unix command line provides lots of flexibility and power, with great power comes great responsibility. Some of the commands are extremely dangerous. rm -rf * is the most famous one. The notation * refers to all files, and the flag -f means forceful deletion (no question asked!), and -r means remove recursively everything under the current directory tree. Accidentally running this command has ruined many files. Read more here rm comes with a -i flag that interactively asks you if you are sure if you want to delete a file. It is a good idea to always run rm -i . On pe111 , we have configured everyone's account so that rm is aliased to rm -i by default. So when you run rm hello.c , it actually runs rm -i hello.c . 1 2 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ rm hello.c rm: remove regular file 'hello.c' ? Type y or n to answer yes or no respectively. If you set up your own UNIX OS, you should add this alias 1 alias rm = \"rm -i\" to your .bashrc (Google to find out how). Other useful aliases to avoid accidentally overwriting existing files are: 1 2 alias mv = \"mv -i\" alias cp = \"cp -i\" cat : CATenate file content to the screen 1 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ cat hello.c less is variant of cat that includes features to read each page leisurely) 1 ooiwt@pe111:~/tut01$ less hello.c In less , use <space> to move down one page, b to move Back up one page, and q to Quit. man : Online MANual An online help facility is available in UNIX via the man command ( man stands for MANual). To look for more information about any UNIX command, for example, ls , type man ls . Type man man and refer to Man Pages to find out more about the facility. To exit man , press q . Now that you are familiar with how the UNIX bash works, I won't show the command prompt any more in the rest of this article. chmod : Changing UNIX File Permission It is important to guide our files properly on a multi-user system where users share the same file system. UNIX has a simple mechanism to for ensuring that: every file and directory has nine bits of access permission, corresponds to three access operations, read ( r ), write ( w ), and execute ( x ), for four classes of users, the user who owns of the file ( u ), users in the same group as the owner ( g ), all other users ( o ), and all users ( a ) (union of all three classes before) When you run ls -l , you will see the permission encoded as strings that look like -rw------- or drwx--x--x besides other file information. The first character indicates if the file is a directory ( d ) or not ( - ). The next three characters are the permission for the owner. rwx means that the owner can do all three: reading, writing, and executing, rw- means that the owner can read and write, but cannot execute. The next three characters are the permission for the users in the same group. The last three characters are the permission for the users in the other groups. To change permission, we use the chmod command. Let's say that we want to remove the read and write permission from all other users in the group. You can run: 1 chmod g-rw <file> where <file> is the name of the file whose permission you want to change. This would change the permission from -rw-rw-rw- to -rw----rw- , or from -rwxr--r-- to -rwx---r-- . To add executable permission to everyone, you can run: 1 chmod a+x <file> This would change the permission from -rw-rw-rw- to -rwxrwxrwx , or from -rwxr--r-- to rwxr-xr-x , and so on. You get the idea. Another way to change the permission is to set the permission directly, instead of adding with + and removing with - . To do this, one convenient way is to treat the permission for each class of user as a 3-bit binary number between 0 to 7. So, rwx is 7, rw- is 6, -w- is 2, --- is 0, etc. To set the permission of a file to -r--r--r-- (readable by everyone), run: 1 chmod 444 <file> To set the permission to -rw------- , run: 1 chmod 600 <file> and so on. It is important to ensure that your code is not readable and writable by other students, especially for graded lab exercises. scp : Secure Copy Secure copy, or scp , is one way to transfer files from the programming environments to your local computer for archiving or storage. Let's say you want to transfer a set of C files from the directory a01 to your local computer, then, on your local computer, run: 1 ooiwt@macbook:~$ scp ooiwt@pe111:~/a01/*.c . Warning If you have files with the same name in the remote directory, the files will be overwritten without warning. I have lost my code a few times due to scp . The expression *.c is a regular expression that means all files with filename ending with .c . You can copy specific files as well. For instance, 1 ooiwt@macbook:~$ scp ooiwt@pe111:~/a01/hello.c . scp supports -r (recursive copy) as well. Specifying A Path in UNIX In any command above, when we need to refer to a directory or a file, we need to specify an unambiguous location of the directory or the file. The most precise way to specify the location is to use the full path, or the absolute path . For instance: 1 cp /home/o/ooiwt/tut01/hello.c /home/o/ooiwt/tut01/hello_world.c That's a lot of characters to type. We could shorten it in a few ways. We could specify the location with respect to the home directory using ~ . ~ooiwt refers to the home directory of user ooiwt . 1 cp ~ooiwt/tut01/hello.c ~ooiwt/tut01/hello_world.c If you are ooiwt , then you can omit ooiwt , since ~ without any username refers to your home directory. 1 cp ~/tut01/hello.c ~/tut01/hello_world.c Or we could specify the location with respect to the current directory. Suppose the current working directory is ~/tut01 (i.e., we have cd into ~/tut01 ), then we could say this: 1 cp ./hello.c ./hello_world.c Recall that a single dot . refers to the current directory. The ./ however is redundant unless you are executing a command. Since, by specifying a file name or a directory without a path (i.e., not using any / ), the bash looks for the file or directory in the current directory. So, we could just do: 1 cp hello.c hello_world.c Another important short form for relative location is .. . Recall that this refers to the parent directory. Suppose that the current directory is in ~/tut02 . Then, to copy the files in ~/tut01 , you can run: 1 cp ../tut01/hello.c ../tut01/hello_world.c I run fish on my macOS, as you might have noticed during the in-class demos. You can use any shell you like if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, bash is a popular one. \u21a9","title":"UNIX"},{"location":"unix.html#basic-unix-commands","text":"UNIX-based operating systems provide a command line to interact with the system: to create directories, to manipulate files, to run certain applications.

It is important to ensure that your code is not readable and writable by other students, especially for graded lab exercises.","title":"chmod: Changing UNIX File Permission"},{"location":"unix.html#scp-secure-copy","text":"Secure copy, or scp , is one way to transfer files from the programming environments to your local computer for archiving or storage. Let's say you want to transfer a set of C files from the directory a01 to your local computer, then, on your local computer, run: 1 ooiwt@macbook:~$ scp ooiwt@pe111:~/a01/*.c . Warning If you have files with the same name in the remote directory, the files will be overwritten without warning. I have lost my code a few times due to scp . The expression *.c is a regular expression that means all files with filename ending with .c . You can copy specific files as well. For instance, 1 ooiwt@macbook:~$ scp ooiwt@pe111:~/a01/hello.c . scp supports -r (recursive copy) as well.","title":"scp: Secure Copy"},{"location":"unix.html#specifying-a-path-in-unix","text":"In any command above, when we need to refer to a directory or a file, we need to specify an unambiguous location of the directory or the file. The most precise way to specify the location is to use the full path, or the absolute path . For instance: 1 cp /home/o/ooiwt/tut01/hello.c /home/o/ooiwt/tut01/hello_world.c That's a lot of characters to type. We could shorten it in a few ways. We could specify the location with respect to the home directory using ~ . ~ooiwt refers to the home directory of user ooiwt . 1 cp ~ooiwt/tut01/hello.c ~ooiwt/tut01/hello_world.c If you are ooiwt , then you can omit ooiwt , since ~ without any username refers to your home directory. 1 cp ~/tut01/hello.c ~/tut01/hello_world.c Or we could specify the location with respect to the current directory. Suppose the current working directory is ~/tut01 (i.e., we have cd into ~/tut01 ), then we could say this: 1 cp ./hello.c ./hello_world.c Recall that a single dot . refers to the current directory. The ./ however is redundant unless you are executing a command. Since, by specifying a file name or a directory without a path (i.e., not using any / ), the bash looks for the file or directory in the current directory. So, we could just do: 1 cp hello.c hello_world.c Another important short form for relative location is .. . Recall that this refers to the parent directory. Suppose that the current directory is in ~/tut02 . Then, to copy the files in ~/tut01 , you can run: 1 cp ../tut01/hello.c ../tut01/hello_world.c I run fish on my macOS, as you might have noticed during the in-class demos. You can use any shell you like if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, bash is a popular one. \u21a9","title":"Specifying A Path in UNIX"},{"location":"vim.html","text":"Vim Tips I collected some tips on vim that I find helpful. If you are new to vim , please try out the command vimtutor on any machine where vim is installed, and check out the nice article Learn vim Progressively . 1. Useful Configuration You can configure your vim by putting your configuration options and scripts in the ~/.vimrc file (a hidden file named .vimrc in your home directory). This file will be loaded whenever you start vim . You can copy a sample .vimrc file from ~cs1010/.vimrc to your home directory. You can edit this file ~/.vimrc just like any other file, using vim . Help In vim, the command :help <topic> shows help about a particular topic in vim . Example, :help backup . Backup Files You can ask vim to automatically backup files that you edit. This has been a lifesaver for me on multiple occasions. In your ~/.vimrc file, 1 set backup will cause a copy of your file to be saved with suffix ~ appended to its name every time you save. I prefer not to clutter my working directory, so I set 1 set backupdir=~/.backup and create a directory named ~/.backup to store my backup files. So if you made changes to a file that you regretted, or if you accidentally deleted a file, you can check under ~/.backup to see if the backup can save you. Syntax Highlighting If for some reasons, syntax highlighting is not on by default, add this to your ~/.vimrc : 1 syntax on Ruler and Numbers If you prefer to show the line number you are on and the column number you are on, adding the commands to ~/.vimrc 1 set ruler will display the line number and the column number on the lower right corner. You can also add 1 set number to label each line with a line number. Auto Indentation Proper indentation is important to make your code readable (to yourself and others). You should enable this in vim with: 1 2 set autoindent set smartindent Autoindent will cause the next line to have the same indentation as the previous line; while smartindent has some understanding of C-like syntax (such as recognizing { and } ) and indent your code accordingly. The size of the indentation is based on the setting shiftwidth . For CS1010, please set it to either 2 or 4 : 1 set shiftwidth=2 2. Navigation Basic Navigation Use K and J keys to move up and down (just like Gmail and Facebook!). H and L to move left and right. Other shortcuts (no need to memorize them now, just refer back when you feel like you are typing too many H J K L to see how you can navigate faster). W jump to the beginning of the next word B ump to the beginning of the previous word (reverse of w ) E jump to the end of the word (or next word when pressed again) F char: search forward in the line and sit on the next matching char T char: search forward in the line and sit on one space before the matching char Shift + 4 ($) jump to the end of line 0 jump to the beginning of the line Shift + 6 (^) jump to the first non-blank character of the line Shift + 5 (%) jump between matching parentheses Ctrl + D jump forward (Down) half page Ctrl + F jump Forward one page Ctrl + U jump backward (Up) half page Ctrl + B jump Backward half page Jumping to a Line If the compiler tells you there is an error on Line \\(x\\) , you can issue :<x> to jump to Line \\(x\\) . For instance, :40 will go to Line 40. 3. Editing Operations Undo Since we are on the topic of correcting mistakes, U in command mode undo your changes. Prefix it with a number \\(n\\) to undo \\(n\\) times. If you want to undo your undo, Ctrl + R will redo. Navigation + Editing vim is powerful because you can combine operations with navigation . For instance C to change, D to delete, Y to yank (copy). Since W is the navigation command to move over the current word, combining them we get: C W change the current word (delete the current word and enter insert mode) D W delete the current word Y W yank the current word (copy word into buffer) Can you guess what each of these do: D F Shift + 0 D F Shift + 0 C Shift + 4 Y 0 If you repeat the operation C , D , and Y , it applies to the whole line, so: C C change the whole line D D delete the whole line Y Y yank the whole line You can add a number before an operation to specify how many times you want to repeat an operation. So 5 D D deletes 5 lines, 5 D W deletes 5 words, etc. See the article Operator, the True Power of Vim for more details. Swapping Lines Sometimes you want to swap the order of two lines of code, in command mode, D D P will do the trick. D D deletes the current line, P paste it after the current line, in effect swapping the order of the two lines. Commenting blocks of code Sometimes we need to comment out a whole block of code in C for testing purposes. There are several ways to do it in vim : Place the cursor on the first line of the block of code you want to comment on. 0 to jump to the beginning of the line Shift + V enter visual mode Use the arrow key to select the block of code you want to comment on. Shift + I to insert at the beginning of the line (here, since we already selected the block, we will insert at the beginning of every selected) / / to insert the C comment character (you will see it inserted in the current line, but don't worry) Esc to escape from the visual code. To uncomment, Place the cursor on the first line of the block of code you want to comment. 0 to jump to the beginning of the line Ctrl + V enter block visual mode Use the arrow key to select the columns of text containing // X to delete them 4. Other Advanced Features Search and Replace in vim 1 :%s/oldWord/newWord/gc : enters the command mode. % means apply to the whole document, s means substitute, g means global (otherwise, only the first occurrence of each line is replaced). c is optional -- adding it cause vim to confirm with you before each replacement Shell Command If you need to issue a shell command quickly, you don't have to exit vim , run the command, and launch vim again. You can use ! , 1 :!<command> will issue the command to shell. E.g., 1 :!ls You can use this to compile your current file, without exiting vim . 1 :!make make is actually a builtin command for vim so you can also simply run 1 :make Abbreviation You can use the command ab to abbreviate frequently typed commands. E.g., in your ~/.vimrc , 1 ab pl cs1010_print_long( Now, when you type pl , it will be expanded into cs1010_print_long( Auto-Completion You can use Ctrl + P or Ctrl + N to auto-complete. By default, the autocomplete dictionary is based on the text in your current editing buffers. This is a very useful keystroke saver for long function and variable names. Auto-Indent the Whole File You can G G = Shift + G in command mode to auto-indent the whole file. G G is the command to go to the beginning of the file. = is the command to indent. Shift + G is the command to go to the end of the file. Splitting vim 's Viewport :sp file.c splits the vim window horizontally :vsp file.c splits the vim window vertically Ctrl + W Ctrl + W moves between the different vim viewports 5.
